# Known Contrast Exceptions (Phase 1)

This file tracks colour combinations that currently fall below the WCAG 2.1 AA 4.5:1 ratio. Each item lists the context, colours, measured ratio, and follow-up plan.

| Component | Context | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Warehouse tab icons | Unselected state | `LopanColors.textSecondary` | `LopanColors.surface` | 3.9:1 | Evaluate tint adjustments or adopt system tab labels during contrast audit. |
| Quick Action badges | Role accent | `LopanColors.roleWarehouseKeeper` | glass overlay | 3.7:1 | Investigate darkened accent token or text outline in Phase 2. |

> Update this list after each audit run. Remove entries once the contrast fix ships or a permanent exception is approved.
