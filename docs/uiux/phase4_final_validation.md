## 🔴 Critical Issues Found & Resolved

During deep Phase 4 investigation, several critical runtime safety issues were discovered and immediately fixed:

### ❌ Force Unwrap Crashes (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Issues Found**: 5 potential crash points
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

1. **LopanMemoryManager.swift:257** - `viewCaches.keys.first!`

   - **Fix**: Added safe guard statement with early return

2. **LopanPerformanceProfiler.swift:196** - `frameTimes.last!` and `.first!`
   - **Risk**: App crash if frameTimes array modified between check and access
   - **Fix**: Added safe optional binding with division-by-zero protection

3. **DataExportEngine.swift:344,350,362,363** - Multiple force unwraps on `fileURL!`
   - **Risk**: App crash if file operations fail and fileURL becomes nil
