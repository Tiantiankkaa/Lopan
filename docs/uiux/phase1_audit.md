# UI/UX Phase 1 Audit (iOS 26 Compliance)

_Updated:_ 2025-09-21 (evening)

## Scope
- Customer Out-of-Stock Dashboard (`CustomerOutOfStockDashboard.swift`)
- Quick statistics tiles (`QuickStatCard`)
- Adaptive date navigation (`AdaptiveDateNavigationBar.swift`)
- Out-of-stock item cards (`OutOfStockCardView.swift`)
- Customer out-of-stock analytics (`CustomerOutOfStockAnalyticsView.swift`)
- Administrator analytics dashboard (`AnalyticsDashboardView.swift`)
- Batch processing workflows (`BatchProcessingView.swift`, `BatchCreationView.swift`)
- Batch management console (`BatchManagementView.swift`)
- Warehouse keeper workbench (`WarehouseKeeperTabView.swift`)

## Summary
| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation hierarchy | ✅ Complete | All major views migrated from `NavigationView` to `NavigationStack`. 59 files successfully migrated via automated script. Remaining 3 files are structural components maintaining `NavigationView` in their naming for backward compatibility. |
| Touch targets | ✅ Aligned | Primary CTAs meet ≥44×44pt; verify analytics filter buttons retain padding after refactor. |
| Dynamic Type | ⚠️ Partial | Sales + admin analytics now scale to AX sizes; batch headers still clamp via `dynamicTypeSize(.small...accessibility1)`—remove caps and preview at AX sizes. |
| Accessibility | ⚠️ Partial | Sales/admin analytics sections expose merged elements; batch detail rows still missing labels/hints and do not expose custom actions. |
| Haptics | ⚠️ Partial | Core dashboard uses helper; batch/warehouse flows still trigger UIKit generators directly. |
| Color/Contrast | ⚠️ Pending | Tokens not applied to analytics/batch backgrounds; glass overlays need contrast audit in dark mode. |
| Localization | ⚠️ Partial | Sales/admin analytics strings extracted to zh-Hans/en; batch and warehouse flows still hard-coded. Extract to `.strings`/`.stringsdict` with English/RTL coverage. |

## Findings & Actions

### Navigation & Structure
- ✅ Removed overlapping toolbar back button (`CustomerOutOfStockDashboard.swift`).
- ✅ Quick stats and filter sheet launched via toolbar menu; confirm no custom bars elsewhere.
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All analytics/batch/warehouse flows successfully migrated from `NavigationView` to `NavigationStack`. Automated migration script processed 59 files including `CustomerOutOfStockAnalyticsView.swift`, `AnalyticsDashboardView.swift`, `BatchProcessingView.swift`, `WarehouseKeeperTabView.swift` and all major user-facing views.
- ✅ **NEW**: Created `NavigationMigrationHelper.swift` in DesignSystem for consistent navigation patterns and iOS 26 compliance utilities.

### Typography & Layout
- ✅ Quick stats/out-of-stock cards now use Dynamic Type (`.title3`, `.headline`, `.footnote`).
- ⏭️ **Action:** Run UI previews for analytics, batch creation, warehouse screens at Dynamic Type XL.
- ⚠️ `AnalyticsCard` and several batch headers clamp typography via `.dynamicTypeSize(.small...accessibility1)`; remove caps and audit multi-line wrapping for long translations.

### Controls & Interactions
- ✅ Quick stats -> real `Button`s; date navigation uses circular chevrons meeting hit-target rule.
- ✅ Haptics/wave: status tabs & cards wrap intensity-checked helper.
- ⏭️ **Action:** Factor the haptic helper into `DesignSystem` package and replace remaining raw generator calls (see `FilterChip`, `ModernAddProductView`).
- ⚠️ Batch workflow sheets expose destructive actions without `confirmationDialog` patterns; introduce overflow menus or `confirmationDialog` for reject flows to stay within one-tap primary action rule.

### Accessibility
- ✅ Out-of-stock cards expose merged elements with custom actions.
- ⏭️ **Action:** VoiceOver sweep across filter sheet (`IntelligentFilterPanel`), analytics sheet (`OutOfStockAnalyticsSheet`), creation flows. Document gaps.
- ⚠️ Analytics cards and batch list rows surface multiple text nodes without merged accessibility elements; need `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` plus labels/values.

### Localization & Formatting
- ⏭️ **Action:** Collect all user-visible strings into `.strings`/`.stringsdict`. Pseudo-localization run still outstanding.
- ⏭️ **Action:** Wrap remaining date/time displays with `Date.FormatStyle` to avoid hard-coded formats.
- ❌ Analytics/batch/warehouse modules currently hard-code zh-Hans copy; create localization spreadsheet and add CI check for missing translations.
- ✅ Fixed `%@` vs `%d` placeholder mismatch for machine metrics in batch creation strings to prevent `String(format:)` crashes (see `batch_creation_machine_station_count`, `batch_creation_machine_gun_count`, and related error messages).

### Design Tokens
- ✅ `Lopan/DesignSystem/README.md` outlines colour/typography/spacing/motion tokens and Phase 1 migration items.
- ⏭️ **Action:** Inventory existing color/font/spacing constants; migrate remaining stragglers into shared tokens.

### Analytics Screens (Customer + Admin)
- ✅ `Lopan/Views/Salesperson/CustomerOutOfStockAnalyticsView.swift` now ships on `NavigationStack`, adopts design-system spacing/tints (with LiquidGlass fallback pre-iOS 26), drives numeric transitions that respect Reduce Motion, and uses localized strings with merged accessibility elements.
- ✅ `Lopan/Views/Administrator/AnalyticsDashboardView.swift` now runs on `NavigationStack`, reuses design tokens (with LiquidGlass fallback), respects Reduce Motion, and sources all copy from zh-Hans/en strings with labeled sections.
- ✅ `AnalyticsOverviewWidget`/`ProductionMetricsChart` now draw from design tokens, respect Reduce Motion, and pull all copy from zh-Hans/en localization; legacy chart fallbacks remain for iOS 15.
- ✅ Sales dashboards (`CustomerOutOfStockDashboard`, `BatchReturnProcessingSheet`, `BatchOutOfStockCreationView`, `ReturnOrderExportView`) migrated to `LopanColors`/`LopanSpacing` for primary state, warning, and success treatments.
- ⏭️ **Action:** Add preview groups covering Dynamic Type XL, dark mode, and `layoutDirection` RTL for both analytics views to validate layout and mirroring.

- ✅ `Lopan/Views/WorkshopManager/BatchProcessingView.swift` now runs on `NavigationStack`, pulls UI copy from zh-Hans/en strings, respects Reduce Motion, and reuses the shared WorkshopManager service provider.
- ✅ Batch machine selection cards now fully localized (toggle, empty states, accessibility labels) and placeholder types corrected to avoid runtime crashes.
- ✅ Batch creation screen now routes machine pagination, product IDs, and cache/system diagnostics overlays through zh-Hans/en localization to remove remaining hard-coded strings.
- ⚠️ `BatchCreationView.swift` now consumes the WorkshopManager service provider for core services, but cache/synchronization helpers are still constructed inline—promote them into shared factories and finish string extraction.
- ✅ Administrator `BatchManagementView.swift` now uses `NavigationStack`, sources UI copy from zh-Hans/en strings (including review/timeline overlays), and removes all hard-coded literals.
- ⚠️ Batch review sheets (`ReviewSheet`, `sheetContent`) expose buttons without accessibility hints or confirmation flows; bring them in line with dashboard accessibility patterns and add `confirmationDialog` where destructive.
- ❌ User-facing strings across batch filters, empty states, and toolbars remain hard-coded; extract to `.strings`/`.stringsdict` (zh-Hans/en) with plural handling for counts.
- ⏭️ **Action:** Build snapshot tests in `LopanTests` once layouts stabilize: pending lists (light/dark, zh-Hans/en) and creation flow at Dynamic Type XL.

- ✅ `Lopan/Views/WarehouseKeeper/WarehouseKeeperTabView.swift` now wraps the tab experience in `NavigationStack`, localizes tab titles/search labels, and routes quick actions through zh-Hans/en keys.
- ✅ Quick action menu strings (titles, subtitles, role badges) are localized and analytics logging now uses stable identifiers; inline rejects prompt confirmation dialogs.
- ⚠️ Quick actions sheet and tab icons rely on custom colors (`LopanColors.roleWarehouseKeeper`) without contrast verification; audit against WCAG 2.1 in both appearances and document any exceptions.
- ⚠️ Preloading haptics call `HapticFeedback.light()` unconditionally; route through the centralized helper and honor `Reduce Motion` and `isOtherAudioPlaying` before triggering.
- ✅ Accessibility checklist added at `docs/uiux/accessibility_checklist.md` to guide VoiceOver/Switch Control validation.
- ⏭️ **Action:** Add VoiceOver runs covering tab changes and quick actions to ensure merged accessibility elements and correct focus order.

## Next Steps (Phase 1)
1. Extend this audit to analytics, batch operations, warehouse views.
2. Produce Dynamic Type & localization preview screenshots for top screens.
3. ✅ `DesignSystem` token definitions captured in `Lopan/DesignSystem/README.md`; migrate remaining literals to tokens.
4. ✅ Accessibility checklist added (`docs/uiux/accessibility_checklist.md`)—run it before Phase 1 exits.
5. Prioritize conversion of analytics/batch/warehouse stacks to `NavigationStack` (plus `NavigationSplitView` for regular width).
6. Begin localization extraction for batch/warehouse modules and wire into CI missing-keys check.
7. Schedule accessibility + contrast validation sessions (VoiceOver, Reduce Motion, WCAG color audit) across newly scoped flows (sales analytics ready as baseline).
8. Add snapshot/UI coverage for analytics shared components (overview + metrics charts) across locales, appearances, and legacy chart fallbacks.
