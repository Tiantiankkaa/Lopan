# Apple Sign In Setup Instructions

To complete the Apple Sign In implementation, you need to enable the capability in Xcode:

## Steps to Enable Apple Sign In:

1. **Open your project in Xcode**
   - Open `Lopan.xcodeproj`

2. **Select your target**
   - Click on your project name in the navigator
   - Select the `Lopan` target

3. **Add Sign In with Apple capability**
   - Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Click the "+ Capability" button
   - Search for and add "Sign In with Apple"

4. **Configure your Apple Developer Account**
   - Ensure you have a valid Apple Developer Account
   - The capability will automatically configure the necessary entitlements

## Important Notes:

- **Apple Sign In is mandatory** for apps that use third-party authentication on the App Store
- The implementation is already complete in the code - you just need to enable the capability
- Users can sign in with Apple ID, phone number (SMS), or the simulated WeChat method

## Testing:

- Apple Sign In will work on physical devices and simulator (iOS 13+)
- SMS authentication uses demo code "1234" for testing
- The authentication flow automatically handles user creation and login

## Production Considerations:

For production deployment, you'll need to:
1. Integrate with a real SMS service (like Aliyun SMS for China)
2. Replace the simulated WeChat login with actual WeChat SDK if needed
3. Configure proper error handling and user feedback

The authentication system now supports multiple methods that are popular with Chinese users while maintaining security best practices.
