Production Configuration Functionality Requirements:
- Understand the current production configuration process by selecting a single production device - selecting a production mode - creating a batch - adding a product - selecting a product - selecting a gun color - selecting a gun - selecting the number of stations - and submitting for review;
- Approve production plans for the current and next day, adding batch settings and submission capabilities;
- When the next day's production plan is largely the same as the current day's, and only a few machines require adjustments, individual approval is inefficient;
- If a machine has already been submitted for approval, including it in a batch operation will result in duplicate approvals and waste resources;
- Approved machines will be highlighted or grayed out;
